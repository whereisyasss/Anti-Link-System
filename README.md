## __How to use it ❓__

### It's really that easy, first you go to [config.json](https://github.com/whereisyasss/Anti-Link-System/tree/main/config.json) : 

```json
{
    "TOKEN": "your_token_here",
    "PREFIX": "!",
    "OWNER_ID": "your_discord_id"
}
```
``If there is no problem, you'll see this, then you replace "TOKEN" by your bot token that you generated, and "OWNER_ID" by your discord id (to copy it you need to activate developer features on the app), don't forget those details : ``
- The token is required for your bot in order to make him log in and works
- The id is required so if you put it you will be able to use toggles (on/off) and you will be able to whitelist/unwhitelist people which will bypass this system and will also be able to use toggles

### Then if everything is ok, you can run the bot by using [start.bat](https://github.com/whereisyasss/Anti-Link-System/tree/main/start.bat) (the program will install the required packages if you haven't installed them yet)
